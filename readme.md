## Update ‚ö†Ô∏è

On December 11, 2022, OpenAI implemented additional protections through Cloudflare to enhance security for the unofficial API. In order to use the API, you will need to obtain and use a valid OpenAI "session token" and Cloudflare "clearance token." It is recommended to refresh your Cloudflare cf_clearance token every hour or so, as these tokens expire after a period of two hours.
